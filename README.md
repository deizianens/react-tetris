## Tetris

In Tetris, players must complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.

This game was made using React. Jest and Enzyme were also used for testing.

### Tetrominoes

A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally (i.e. at the edges and not the corners).
A popular use of tetrominoes is in the video game Tetris. In this game, there's 7 types of tetrominoes: I, O, T, J, L, S, Z
